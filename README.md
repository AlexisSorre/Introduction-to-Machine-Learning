# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

This repository contains my assignments and practical work completed during the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course.  
It serves as a structured collection of notebooks and code implementations covering both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and experiments in fundamental machine learning methods.  
Each notebook focuses on key algorithms, their implementations and limits using Python.

## Topics Covered

- **Supervised Learning**
  - 
  - Linear and Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests  

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-Means,Spectral CLustering)  
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

## Tools Libraries

- Python 3  
- NumPy, pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
